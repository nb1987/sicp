; Description:	The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the 
;				approximation sin x ~= x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity
;
;				sin(x) = 3(sin(x/3)) - 4(sin^3(r/3))
;
;				to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise 
;				an angle is considered ``sufficiently small'' if its magnitude is not greater 
;				than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:
;
;				(define (cube x) (* x x x))
;				(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
;				(define (sine angle)
;					(if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
;					angle 
;					(p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
;
;				a.  How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?
;				b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) 
;					used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
	   
; answer to a: 5  (sine arg = 4.08 .... 1.35 ... 0.45 ... 0.15 ... 0.05)
; answer to b: 
;	Order of growth in space: O(n)
;	Order of growth in number of steps: O(log(n))
